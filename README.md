# Iron Wasp

We are to build an application (native or web) that will display the time table / next departure for busses in the nearby area.


### Planned Features

- Delays
- Next departure (for each busline)
- Colors for different bus lines (yellow for long-distance and green for city)
- if time === ALLOWS
  - Offline mode handling (offline time table to use instead of API if API is offline, show warning on bottom of page)


### Potential Features

- Connecting busses / trains?
- Arrives at Uppsala C (HH:MM)
- Animations (new time)


## Specification

- Very clean (minimalistic)
- Highly user friendly
- Dark mode by default
- Large text (easy to read)
